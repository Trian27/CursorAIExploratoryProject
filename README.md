Creating a basic chat interface with OpenAI model using CursorAI to explore its capabilities. I tested how well CursorAI integrated GPT-4o to build a basic web application that provides a user interface with GPT-4o.

REQUIRED: In settings, at the bottom of the file where it says "YourAPIKeyHere", put in a valid OpenAI API key. Also create a virtual environment to run in with Python installed.
